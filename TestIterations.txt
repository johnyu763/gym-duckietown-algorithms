# Base Case
## Just turns in a circle

# Fix use of max speed to current speed
## Drives slowly in a circle

# Penalty for low speed
## Drives backwards and crashes without being able to speed

# Change Speed to Velocity
## Crashes quickly because prolonged negative penalty worse than penalty for crashing√ü
